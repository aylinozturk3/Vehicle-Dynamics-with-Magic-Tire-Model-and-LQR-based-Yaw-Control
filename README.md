##Overview

This project focuses on modeling and control of vehicle dynamics, using the Magic Tire Formula for accurate tire force modeling and a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for direct yaw moment control.

The main goal is to stabilize the vehicle during maneuvers and improve handling by applying advanced control strategies to a realistic vehicle model.
